# Pomo AI-doro Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Pomo AI-doro application, a productivity tool that combines the Pomodoro technique with AI-powered features. The test plan covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the application functions correctly and reliably.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Completed Unit Tests

- **API Endpoints**
  - `__tests__/app/api/tasks-basic.test.ts`: Tests the CRUD operations for tasks API endpoints
- **Context Providers**
  - `__tests__/lib/contexts/settings-context-simple.test.tsx`: Tests the settings context provider
- **UI Components**
  - `__tests__/components/app/timer-basic.test.tsx`: Tests the timer component
  - `__tests__/components/tasks/task-management-basic.test.tsx`: Tests the task management components

#### Planned Unit Tests

- **Hooks**
  - Test custom hooks like `use-tasks`, `use-timer`, etc.
- **Utility Functions**
  - Test utility functions for date formatting, task sorting, etc.
- **Form Validation**
  - Test form validation logic for task creation and settings

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests focus on testing how components work together.

#### Completed Integration Tests

None yet.

#### Planned Integration Tests

- **Timer and Task Integration**
  - Test how the timer interacts with tasks (e.g., marking tasks as completed after a Pomodoro session)
- **Settings and Timer Integration**
  - Test how changes in settings affect the timer behavior
- **Authentication and API Integration**
  - Test how authentication affects API access

### 3. End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests simulate user interactions with the application.

#### Completed End-to-End Tests

None yet.

#### Planned End-to-End Tests

- **User Authentication Flow**
  - Test user registration, login, and logout
- **Task Management Flow**
  - Test creating, editing, completing, and deleting tasks
- **Pomodoro Timer Flow**
  - Test starting, pausing, and resetting the timer
  - Test transitioning between Pomodoro and break sessions

## Test Implementation Strategy

### 1. Mocking Strategy

- **API Endpoints**: Mock the database and authentication
- **UI Components**: Mock child components and context providers
- **External Services**: Mock any external services or APIs

### 2. Test Data Management

- Use consistent test data across tests
- Reset test data between tests
- Use factories or fixtures for generating test data

### 3. Test Environment

- Use Jest for running tests
- Use React Testing Library for testing React components
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for mocking API requests

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests**: 80% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 60% coverage
- **End-to-End Tests**: Cover all critical user flows

## Continuous Integration

- Run tests on every pull request
- Block merging if tests fail
- Generate test coverage reports

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Unit Tests**
   - Implement tests for hooks and utility functions
2. **Implement Integration Tests**
   - Create tests for timer and task integration
3. **Set Up End-to-End Testing**
   - Set up Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end testing
4. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Identify and fill gaps in test coverage
5. **Set Up Continuous Integration**
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the Pomo AI-doro application. By implementing the tests outlined in this plan, we can ensure the application is reliable, maintainable, and provides a good user experience.
