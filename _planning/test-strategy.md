# Pomo AI-doro Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Pomo AI-doro application. The strategy incorporates best practices for testing Next.js applications in 2025, utilizing a combination of Jest, Vitest, Cypress, and Playwright for different testing needs.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid model:

1. **Unit Tests** (60-70% of tests)

   - Test individual components, functions, and utilities in isolation
   - Fast execution and high coverage
   - Implemented with Jest and Vitest

2. **Integration Tests** (20-30% of tests)

   - Test interactions between components and services
   - Verify that different parts of the application work together
   - Implemented with Jest and Vitest

3. **End-to-End Tests** (5-10% of tests)
   - Test complete user flows and scenarios
   - Verify the application works as expected from a user's perspective
   - Implemented with Cypress and Playwright

## Testing Tools

### Jest

- Primary testing framework for unit and integration tests
- Used for testing React components, hooks, and utility functions
- Configured with React Testing Library for component testing

### Vitest

- Modern, faster alternative to Jest
- Used for unit and integration tests
- Better performance and developer experience
- Integrated with Vite for faster execution

### Cypress

- Used for end-to-end testing
- Tests user flows in a real browser environment
- Provides visual test runner and debugging tools

### Playwright

- Modern end-to-end testing framework
- Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Mobile viewport testing
- Faster execution compared to Cypress

## Test Types and Coverage

### Unit Tests

- **Components**: Test rendering, props, state changes, and user interactions
- **Hooks**: Test custom hooks in isolation
- **Utilities**: Test utility functions and helpers
- **API Routes**: Test API route handlers

### Integration Tests

- **Component Interactions**: Test interactions between related components
- **Context Providers**: Test context providers with consuming components
- **Form Submissions**: Test form validation and submission flows
- **API Integration**: Test integration with backend services

### End-to-End Tests

- **User Flows**: Test complete user journeys (login, timer usage, task management)
- **Authentication**: Test login, registration, and authentication flows
- **Responsive Design**: Test application on different viewport sizes
- **Accessibility**: Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

## Test Organization

Tests are organized in the following directory structure:

```
__tests__/
  ├── components/       # Jest component tests
  ├── lib/             # Jest utility and hook tests
  ├── app/             # Jest page and API route tests
  ├── integration/     # Jest integration tests
  ├── vitest/          # Vitest tests
  │   ├── components/  # Vitest component tests
  │   ├── lib/         # Vitest utility and hook tests
  │   └── integration/ # Vitest integration tests
  └── playwright/      # Playwright E2E tests
cypress/
  ├── e2e/            # Cypress E2E tests
  └── component/      # Cypress component tests
```

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Component Isolation**: Test components in isolation to promote reliability and reduce dependencies.
2. **Snapshot Testing**: Use snapshot testing to streamline the development process and enhance confidence in component integrity.
3. **TypeScript Integration**: Leverage TypeScript to enhance the testing experience with more precise assertions.
4. **Test Categorization**: Regularly review and categorize tests into unit, integration, and end-to-end types.
5. **Continuous Integration**: Execute tests automatically on pull requests to catch defects early.
6. **Code Coverage**: Aim for at least 90% code coverage to detect untested code paths.
7. **Refactoring Tests**: Refactor tests alongside code changes to reduce technical debt.

## Test Execution

Tests can be executed using the following npm scripts:

```bash
# Jest tests
pnpm test                # Run all Jest tests
pnpm test:watch          # Run Jest tests in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage       # Run Jest tests with coverage report

# Vitest tests
pnpm test:vitest         # Run all Vitest tests
pnpm test:vitest:watch   # Run Vitest tests in watch mode
pnpm test:vitest:coverage # Run Vitest tests with coverage report

# Playwright tests
pnpm test:playwright     # Run all Playwright tests
pnpm test:playwright:ui  # Run Playwright tests with UI

# Cypress tests
pnpm cypress             # Open Cypress test runner
pnpm test:e2e            # Run Cypress E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e:headless   # Run Cypress E2E tests headlessly

# Run all tests
pnpm test:all            # Run all tests (Jest, Vitest, Playwright)
```

## Continuous Integration

All tests are executed in the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The workflow includes:

1. **Linting**: Check code quality and style
2. **Jest Tests**: Run all Jest tests
3. **Vitest Tests**: Run all Vitest tests
4. **Playwright Tests**: Run all Playwright tests
5. **Build**: Build the application
6. **Deploy**: Deploy to Vercel (only on main branch)

## Test Data Management

1. **Mock Data**: Use mock data for unit and integration tests
2. **Test Database**: Use a separate test database for E2E tests
3. **Fixtures**: Store test fixtures in dedicated directories
4. **Factories**: Use factory functions to generate test data

## Visual Regression Testing

1. **Percy Integration**: Integrate Percy for visual regression testing
2. **Snapshot Comparison**: Compare visual snapshots to detect UI changes
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test visual consistency across browsers

## Accessibility Testing

1. **Automated Checks**: Use axe-core for automated accessibility checks
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Test keyboard navigation in E2E tests
3. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Test screen reader announcements

## Performance Testing

1. **Lighthouse Integration**: Integrate Lighthouse for performance testing
2. **Load Testing**: Test application under load using k6
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor performance metrics in production

## Future Improvements

1. **Test Automation**: Increase test automation coverage
2. **Test Data Generation**: Improve test data generation strategies
3. **Test Reporting**: Enhance test reporting and visualization
4. **Test Stability**: Improve test stability and reduce flakiness
5. **Test Performance**: Optimize test execution time
